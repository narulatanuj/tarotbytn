<meta name="description" content="Tanuj, narula, tanuj j narula, narula j, Psychic, psychic medium, medium, chemisty,A few years ago I attended a psychic and mediumship seminar in Melbourne, Australia, to observe a Medium work, and from that day I knew this was one of the things what I wanted to do with my life. This was the beginning of my pathway to becoming a Tarot and Psychic reader. Over the years that followed, whilst learning and further developing at the Arthur Findlay College of Spiritual Science, I have taken every opportunity to develop and demonstrate my skills, intending to reunite relatives with their departed loved ones or to give you insights on your future. So, let me tell you what I do – the ability I have is to make contact with loved ones who have died. That’s how this started for me. That contact can be through one or more of the following senses - seeing, hearing, feeling or just knowing. The second faculty, commonly known as the psychic dimension, that opens is my ability to read you – and that’s looking at the auric field and the energy that surrounds you. It gives me an opportunity to see the Architect’s plan of the soul – not the conscious mind, but of the soul and sometimes the two can be very different. Whilst the insights I give are based on the current life path you are on, please always remember life, at the end of the day, will depend on the choices you make – that's your free will or self-governance at work.">

    	<h2>About <span>Myself</span></h2>
        <div  class="txt-cent"><p>A few years ago TJ attended a psychic and mediumship seminar in Melbourne, Australia, to observe a Medium work, and from that day TJ knew this was one of the things he wanted to do with his life. That was the beginning of his pathway to becoming a Psychic Medium.</p>
<p>
Once TJ begun to consciously develop his Mediumship, TJ was quickly led to the Arthur Findlay College (London), the world’s foremost college for the Advancement of Mediumship and Psychic Sciences, where he embarked on an intensive study and development of his mediumistic abilities. It was here that he met his mentor, one of the finest teachers and exponents of Mediumship, who has significantly influenced TJ’s mediumistic development.</p>
<p>
TJ has built a solid foundation based on the quality and accuracy of his work, his compassion, and the demonstration style he is unfolding.</p>  
<p>So, let me tell you what I do....<br><br>The ability I have is to make contact with loved ones who have died. That’s how this started for me. That contact can be through one or more of the following senses - seeing, hearing, feeling or just knowing. The second faculty, commonly known as the psychic dimension, is my ability to read you – and that’s looking at the auric field, the chakras and the energy fields. It gives me an opportunity to see the Architect’s plan of the soul – not the conscious mind, but of the soul and sometimes the two can be very different. It is on this soul plan, your life path, that my honest insights are based on. A reading with me is a three way process involving the spirit world, the medium and you.</p>

        	<p>I got an opportunity to know Tanuj on my visit to Melbourne last year . I heard about his great ability to read peoples auras and energy fields to a great accuracy. This tempted me to take a sitting with him....and i must say i am hugely impressed. His honesty , frankness and patience is something that strikes you the most. He revealed so much which only i would have known .It has helped me to see and plan my life with a new perspective.....I am a happier person ever since .I have already recommended a lot of my friends and family to take a sitting with him.....its more than worth it.</p>

        	<p>I heard about TJ and his ability through my cousin in Australia and I was immediately intrigued by the idea of a psychic reading. I got my reading done in February, 2015 and I was astonished by the accuracy of the information he gathered by connecting with my deceased loved one. He also gave a very accurate description of my personality and guided me by giving me a sense of direction and a glimpse of what I'll be facing in the near future. I would highly recommend TJ to anyone who's looking for clarity and a sense of direction in their life.</p>

        	<p>It was a great feeling to meet Tanuj through my brother he is an amazing person and a great reader. I highly recommend all of you to get a reading from him once atleast. After his reading, I felt so relaxed.I am glad Tanuj you told me the truth and not what I wanted to hear. Thanks for letting me know that who my guides are and what they say.You answered my questions really patiently.
Once agian a Thumbs up to your reading, you were very accurate.God bless you TJ and thanks once again.</p>

        	<p>TJ gives not only a message, he delivers the connection and therefore energy of your deceased loved one... He is able to get into this specific energy and gives you the information that defines a person. The combination he makes with his psychic abilities makes a reading a journey of its own. He is very respectful and caring for his recipiënt. Highly recommended.</p>

        	<p>I've had 2 readings with TJ and both times I was really surprised by how great and light I felt after the reading. I found him to be really connected and intuitive about where I was in life. The last time I saw him, he mentioned a project that had been on mind and which I was scared to undertake, saying I must do it. I hadn't even told anyone about this project, not even my husband lol. That was somewhat spooky to me lol. Anyway, I could talk to TJ forever and ever if time permitted. He is such an attentive listener, which is a great bonus. I recommend anyone to spend some time with him.</p>

        	<p>I was fortunate to meet TJ a couple of months ago and have found his teachings, thoughts and advice to be very insightful,enlightening and thought provoking. Interesting does not fully encapsulate it. He adopts a very simple and kind yet effective clinical thought process mechanism that really makes you think and analyse yourself introspectively. Don't be fooled by the softly spoken exterior,as inside there is an extremely sharp, witty and analytical mind. He is a lovely person who you just feel you could talk to for hours on a wide range of topics and interests. I would recommend, no strongly advocate that you if you have the opportunity to spend some time, listen or have a session with TJ to absolutely do so. It will stand you in very good stead and you would be surprised how much it will help you.</p>

Your readings have really helped me move on in life. You truly have a wonderful gift and im sure you will achieve a lot of success in life.
