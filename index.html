        	<p>TJ gives not only a message, he delivers the connection and therefore energy of your deceased loved one... He is able to get into this specific energy and gives you the information that defines a person. The combination he makes with his psychic abilities makes a reading a journey of its own. He is very respectful and caring for his recipiënt. Highly recommended.</p>

        	<p>I've had 2 readings with TJ and both times I was really surprised by how great and light I felt after the reading. I found him to be really connected and intuitive about where I was in life. The last time I saw him, he mentioned a project that had been on mind and which I was scared to undertake, saying I must do it. I hadn't even told anyone about this project, not even my husband lol. That was somewhat spooky to me lol. Anyway, I could talk to TJ forever and ever if time permitted. He is such an attentive listener, which is a great bonus. I recommend anyone to spend some time with him.</p>

        	<p>I was fortunate to meet TJ a couple of months ago and have found his teachings, thoughts and advice to be very insightful,enlightening and thought provoking. Interesting does not fully encapsulate it. He adopts a very simple and kind yet effective clinical thought process mechanism that really makes you think and analyse yourself introspectively. Don't be fooled by the softly spoken exterior,as inside there is an extremely sharp, witty and analytical mind. He is a lovely person who you just feel you could talk to for hours on a wide range of topics and interests. I would recommend, no strongly advocate that you if you have the opportunity to spend some time, listen or have a session with TJ to absolutely do so. It will stand you in very good stead and you would be surprised how much it will help you.</p>

        	<p>Merry xmas TJ! Thanks for the awesome reading! You were pretty accurate about the current plus very blunt and direct. You didn't tell me what i wanted to hear and told me the truth. I wish more readers were like that. I'll be recommending you and coming back for more readings. Thanks again</p>

Had you not been there i would have lived my life in guilt, i don't know for how long. Everything you said was true and i couldn't believe how you know so much and in so much detail.  Your readings have really helped me move on in life. You truly have a wonderful gift and im sure you will achieve a lot of success in life. May God bless you and may you help lots and lots more people of my kind who need closures and peace.</p>

        	<p>TJ, is intuitive , perceptive and can through his many psychic skills , offer you layer after layer of insight into past events and glimpses to the future as well . He is always mindful of his client and takes great care in accompanying then on what was for me a journey of discovery . I can't say enough in support of TJ</p>

I will be going back!</p>
